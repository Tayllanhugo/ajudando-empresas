                <p>The combined experience i have working at the top Fortune <br> 500 companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that <br> helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any <br> business. </p> 
                <p>I'm proud to announce that I am now Working at one of the <br> worlds largest communities taching young minds about how <br> to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new <br> world of oppotunities.</p>
                <p>As a developer, you have everything available to you and all <br> that's holding you back is yourself.</p>
                <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
                <p>"How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't fail?" <br> You've already gone through the hardest parts being a <br> developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader <br> in something you're passionate about.</p>
                <p>I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help <br> your company.</p>
